# ADC configuration

[ADC]
  # The Waveshare ADC is a ADS1256 8-channel single, 4-channel differential
  # ADC.

  # The ADC sampling rate for all channels
  #
  # "sample_rate" must be one of the following supported sampling rates:
  # 30000, 15000, 7500, 3750, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 60, 50, 30, 25, 15, 10, 5
  sample_rate=30000

  # The Waveshare board has a single common reference for all single-ended
  # ADC channels. This setting is used to provide ADC->voltage conversion. Value
  # is in volts. If the jumper is connected from AINCOM to AGND, then this value
  # should be 0 wich gives a full-scale-rage of 0->5V at unity gain. If
  # for example, AINCOM is connected to 2.5V, then the voltage output is
  # -2.5->2.5V at 23-bits of precision for a unity gain.
  AINCOM=0.0

  # The ADC1256 reference voltage. This value is nominally 2.5V based on the
  # board's included LM285-2.5 reference voltage. This value is likely not
  # precisely 2.5V. The ADC1256 full-scale range is 2*VRef. If you have
  # actually measured the reference voltage on the actual ADC, you can change
  # this value to the measured value here if you find it to be off or need
  # higher accuracy. Note, the reference voltage likely drifts as the chip
  # heats up. On my board, Vref is measured at a stable 2.524V which translates
  # into a couple of hundreds of a volt offset which is starting to get into
  # the noise floor
  Vref=2.5

  # The ADC programmable gain for all channels
  #
  # "gain" must be one of the following 7 possible gain settings
  # 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
  gain=1

  # Channel configuration
  #
  # The ADS1256 can be configured as 8 single-ended or 4 differential channels
  # In any combination.
  channel=0,COM

  channel=1,COM
